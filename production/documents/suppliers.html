    <td>The Orlander Company</td>
    <td><a href="http://orlander.com">http://orlander.com</a></td>
    <td>(408) 735-1850</td>
    <td>144 Commercial Street, Sunnyvale, CA</td>
    <td>The Orlander company is a vendor that sells only fasteners.  If it is a fastener, odds are pretty good that they have it.  They have a warehouse the size of the Auditorium full of boxes of various fasteners.  The normal mode of buying things here is driving over, going to the counter, and asking.  The website is useless.  Also, calling is mostly useless.  Also, if buying in bulk, they might give (or you can negotiate at the counter) discounts, especially on rarely sold parts, like bearings. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Metal Supermarkets</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.metalsupermarkets.com">http://www.metalsupermarkets.com</a></td>
    <td>(408) 654-9177</td>
    <td>3 locations, closest is at 705 Comstock Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054-3422</td>
    <td>Website is a good price estimator, but place orders on the phone.  They give good discounts (~20%) to robotics teams, just state that this is for one.<br />
      If it’s a really small piece, they might just give it to you.  Do not go there looking for short pieces.... It’s generally cheaper to buy one huge piece and cut it down ourselves.  Wtheir sheet metal, they are capable of making precise and clean cuts.<br />
    They also have a nice remnants pile.  Go through and check it out.  While it will not sell anything very large, it has a large variety at a very low price.  (priced by the pound)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Home Depot, aka &quot;Home Despot&quot;</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.homedepot.com">http://www.homedepot.com</a></td>
    <td>Good luck calling them</td>
    <td>They have lots of locations.  The one by San Jose Airport is not usually bysy Use their online store-checker if possible, before you make a run there.</td>
    <td>Good to buy wood and materials that you’d normally find in homes (electrical tools, weatherstripping, ect).  Metal is expensive here, and their fasteners, while cheap in bulk, are not what we need.  All they sell is boxes of bolts with hex-cap (ie, box wrench) heads with incomplete threading.  Buy non-wood materials from home depot only as a last-ditch maneuver.  Their plastic is not too diverse (limited mostly to 1/16th plastic sheeting), but it is priced more fairly.  Again, expect high prices, but good quality for things normally found in homes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Halted (HSC)</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.halted.com/">http://www.halted.com/</a></td>
    <td>(408) 732-1573</td>
    <td>3500 Ryder Street, Santa Clara</td>
    <td>Halted is an electronics store.  They have isles full of electronic components ranging from racks of wires to switches, motors, and fans.  They are not a commercial-grade store, nor are their prices egregious.  It almost has a feel of a electronics garage sale, and for that reason, their website will be almost completely useless.  That being said, they have many generic electronic components such as potentiometers, limit switches, and connectors to be of use to E-team.  It’s just up to the buyer to find the appropriate one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hancock Fabrics</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hancockfabrics.com/">http://www.hancockfabrics.com/</a></td>
    <td>1600 Saratoga Ave # 505</td>
    <td>(408) 871-0145</td>
    <td>Hancock fabrics is the place to buy the bumper material.  It turns out that the cordura we use is classified as “flag material”, ie, fabric suitable for a flag.  They are located inside the Westgate Mall.  It is sometimes hit-or miss if they have the colors we need, but fortunately, red and blue are common flag colors.  You may have to go to their other bay area location to purchase what cannot be purchased at the first. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leslie’s pool supplies</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.lesliespool.com/">http://www.lesliespool.com/</a></td>
    <td>1355 South Bascom Avenue, San Jose, CA</td>
    <td>(408) 971-8033</td>
    <td>Leslie’s pool supplies is one location in the area which will be guaranteed to have pool noodles.  However, they will be expensive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grainger</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.grainger.com/">http://www.grainger.com/</a></td>
    <td>2261 Ringwood Ave., San Jose, CA</td>
    <td>(408) 432-8200</td>
    <td>Grainger is essentially a mcMaster-Carr, except, in person.  I cannot overstate how many unique parts I was able to get from Grainger when we could not wait for Mc Master to come through.  There are multiple Grainger stores throughout the bay area, but the best bet is to go to the distribution center, which I have listed up above.  Normally, Grainger caters to businesses with accounts set up, even Harker has one.  Do not purchase off that account, but instead make the purchase yourself.  The salesperson might balk a bit, but he or she can do it.  Furthermore, Grainger’s website is up to date and contains specific detail about parts, although you have to call to figure out if the distribution center has the specific part or not.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>mcMaster-Carr</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/">http://www.mcmaster.com/</a></td>
    <td>mcMaster is the gold standard for parts suppliers.  In general, if it is a physical, technical part of some kind, they have it.  They have a myriad of products, from fasteners, to end mills, to foam.  The quality of the products that they sell is also above-average.  Due to the location that Harker is in, it does not make a difference between rush shipping or not-rush shipping, both takes two or three days, depending on the time the order was placed.  Expect to pay above-average prices for most of their products, but it is sometimes worth it.  While Grainger has more products, they are much, much more diverse.  Therefore, mcMaster will almost guranteed to have the part you need, if it exists.  Furthermore, due to their centralized location, they do not run out of parts and/or have lead-times like Grainger can. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>AndyMark</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.andymark.com/">http://www.andymark.com/</a></td>
    <td>Andymark is a significant FRC part supplier.  They are known for supplying about 30% of the kit-of-parts materials.  They sell the famous kit-c-channel and are the ones who designed the famous kit drive train.  They sell many standard mechanical and electrical components, such as the toughboxes, cim motors, and digital sidecars.  Andymark is a business built around FRC, so for any FRC-specific parts, andymark may have them.  Shipping with andymark is a challenge.  They are located in indiana, and during build often have extremely long ship times due to being snowed in, and their small staff.  Therefore, it may be suggestible that we obtain often-used components, such as c-channel, encoders, Toughboxes and kit-wheel compatible sprockets before build even starts.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Banebots</td>
    <td><a href="http://banebots.com/">http://banebots.com/</a></td>
    <td>Banebots is also a kit supplier.  Banebots specializes in motors and gearboxes for them.  They make the banebots motors and the planetary gearboxes for them.  When ordering banebots components, it may be advisable to buy them from a 3rd party online vendor, as they have no mention of a 10-15 day lead-time on their website as banebots.com does.</td>

    <td>ifiRobotics</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com">http://www.vexrobotics.com</a></td>
    <td>ifiRobotics was a very important supplier in the past, supplying thing such as the RC, the victors, and the old style kitmetal.  They are now part of the vex robotics system. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bimba</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.bimba.com/">http://www.bimba.com/</a></td>
    <td>Bimba is the company that makes most of our pneumatic pistons.  Every year, in the kit, there is a link to this website, allowing us to order three pistons for free.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gates Company</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.gatesprograms.com/">http://www.gatesprograms.com/</a></td>
    <td>The gates company is a company that makes timing belts and timing belt pulleys.  Last year we could order a few timing belts and timing belt pulleys for free.  While the belts were not especially useful due to their short length, the pulleys are more useful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enco</td>
    <td><a href="http://use-enco.com/">http://use-enco.com/</a></td>
    <td>Enco is somewhat of a cross between mcMaster-carr and Grainger, in that they have the product selection of Grainger, yet are online only.  They also appear to have a larger selection of large tools than either Grainger or mcMaster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Merlin Tools</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.merlintools.ltd.uk/">http://www.merlintools.ltd.uk/</a></td>
    <td>They are a company based out of england.  They are listed because they are the only company I have been able to find with extremely small Endmills (1/16th) that the CNC can use.  To purchase, you will have to go through a local distributor, as they won’t sell to individuals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Online Metals</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com/">http://www.onlinemetals.com/</a></td>
    <td>They are a company based out of Washington state.  They are the best online metal supplier that they know.  Shipping will take 3 to 4 buisness days.  Their prices for metal are generally lower than any other metal supplier, even with Metal Supermarket’s discounts.</td>
